This is a GitHub Repository for MMED-1055 Multimedia Authoring 2 - Homework 1 - Interactive SVG Icons
## Homework 1 - Interactive SVG Icons - Assignment Brief
Each Student must build a branded, scalable themed icon set using Adobe Illustrator. Export each icon from Illustrator as an SVG. Use the SVGs as assets on the FIP/Brand Revival site (think icons for different flavours or ingredients). Add some simple interac>vity with JavaScript. Use HTML (and the appropriate elements) to include a descrip>on of the icon set.

Use CSS interac>ons or transi>ons to change the icon’s appearance (on hover, as an example, reverse all of the colours or add a drop shadow, etc). When clicked log a message to the console with the ID of the element that you’ve clicked. The ID should be retrieved and displayed with a JavaScript string template and variable (refer to the class example).
